## Data Availability

We have not made the interleaved FASTQ files for the nine air samples collected from Minnesota in Table 2 available on GitHub because of their large file size. SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD sequencing data generated in this study have been deposited in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under bioproject [PRJNA811594](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA811594).

To reproduce the analysis in the manuscript, we recommend downloading the raw FASTQ files from SRA Bioproject PRJNA811594 into the 'data/' directory.
